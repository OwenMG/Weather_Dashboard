# Weather_Dashboard

This is the 6th assignment in the BCS Full Stack Flex, a Weather Dashboard Website using the OpenWeather API.

I created and tested API keys, built an html page to house the data, and then created javascript that allowed the user to search for a city and generate a search history button.

I added the ability to see the current weather conditions for the chosen city, as well as a 5 day forecast.

However, I failed to build the forecast in a way conducive to using the history buttons, and as a result trying to search for another city after the first destroys the forecast section. I will be resubmitting this assignment once this issue is fixed, as well as having added icons.
